# TutorFinder
Names of Developers: Adrian Hogan, Archit Khanna, David Bromell

The basic idea for this App was to create an online application which would enable students who require 
extra help to get in contact with tutors in the subject with which they are struggling . 
This idea was based off the premis of tinder in that the users location would be taken into account and it would
then implicate a radius in which the strugling student could search in for the requried tutor. 
The main goal of this progam is to provide an accesable medium which would enable students to easily 
access educational resources while contemporaneously allowing students/tutors/lecturers to earn extra income
